Set Executable Permission: In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your app bundle and make your Python script executable by running the following command:

open a terminal at your file location then
chmod +x Contents/MacOS/Drone-Feedpy

can run it from the terminal:
./ATGS.app/Contents/MacOS/Drone-Feed.py
This should execute your Python script as a macOS application.
