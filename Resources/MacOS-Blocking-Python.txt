Apple will block your app if you need to access the a user's webcam or video input. This is the work around mac os. 

Mac is not going to let you run the file in some/all cases because the code will want access to a webcam as default. 
These are the steps to avoid that issue. Plist is a huge headache.. but I hope this helps. Submit a request if you need help setting it up.

Directory structure should look like this:
1.
ATGS.app/
├── Contents/
│ ├── Info.plist
│ └── MacOS/
│ └── Drone-Feed.py Homebase-Server.py ... etc
└── Resources/
└── Readme and license.

2. Create a info.plist file
\f0\fs24 \cf0 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">\
<plist version="1.0">\
<dict>\
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>\
    <string>Drone-Feed.py</string>\
    <key>Drone-Feed-ID</key>\
    <string>com.yourcompany.YourApp</string>\
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\
    <string>We need access to your camera to capture images for video streaming.</string>\
    <!-- Add other keys as needed -->\
</dict>\
</plist>\
}

3. Set Executable Permission: In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your app bundle and make your Python script executable by running the following command:

open a terminal at your file location then:
chmod +x Contents/MacOS/Drone-Feed.py

Run it from the terminal:
./ATGS.app/Contents/MacOS/Drone-Feed.py

Python3 Drone-Feed.py

This should execute your Python script as a macOS application.
